PROBLEM 1-1
A good hash function should generate a Gaussian distribution
=> False

PROBLEM 1-2
A deterministic program always returns the same result for the same input
=> True

PROBLEM 1-3
The coefficient of variation is better than the standard deviation for comparing the variation in the number of residents of different cities or towns to the variation in the number of residents in different countries
=> True

PROBLEM 1-4
Monte Carlo simulations can only be used to solve stochastic problems
=> False

PROBLEM 1-5
Uniform distributions are usually the most useful for modeling complex systems
=> False

PROBLEM 1-6
Consider the following code:

import random
for i in range(1000):
    randomList1.append(int(random.random() * 2))

for i in range(1000):
    randomList2.append(random.choice((0,1)))

In Python, randomList1 and randomList2 will have the same distribution pattern
=> True
